## blukat29/distorm

This is fork of [distorm by Gil Dabah](https://github.com/gdabah/distorm).

Changes since 3.3.4 (as of commit [fa19640](https://github.com/gdabah/distorm/commit/fa196409f2fc699edd8bcba61a001f18fd895c75)):

- Removes the "priviledged flag" behavior in which the large `_InstInfo` table is modified at runtime.
  Now tables are declared read-only.

- Correctly initialize list of nested structures `_InstInfoEx`.

- Add a script (`disOps/update.sh`) that conveniently updates the constant tables generated by python scripts.

- Add a minimal test program that compares its output against objdump.
